  My Road to full stack developer + my comment
  
  ᴡᴇᴇᴋ 1 - Get to know Html
  
  ᴡᴇᴇᴋ 2 - The index is starting to look cool.
         - attach pics, add links,make a table and also make it looks pretty by CSS
         - I never thought that moving or deleting gaps between blocks could be this hard, but I can still do it anyway. It's just creeping me out, lol.
  
  ᴡᴇᴇᴋ 3 - We've gone further than I thought, but I still want to learn more about HTML and CSS.it's bring me so much joy!
         - move pics so freely, the div is soooooo fun, 
         - I hope next week we might learn how to do the animation.
